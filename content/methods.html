<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>We pulled from the Community Capital and Ecological frameworks to inform us for potential data sources.</p>
<p>The Comunity Capital Framework is an approach to analyze communities and economic mobility. The framework includes seven types of capital: Built Capital, Human Capital, Social Capital, Financial Capital, Political Capital, Cultural Capital, and Natural Capital.</p>
<p>To better understand the community in Page and surrounding counties, we focused on the first six types of capital.</p>

<p>In addition, we approached the research questions from an Ecological Framework as well. In the Ecological Framework, some people are at higher risk or more vulnerable because of multiple factors at different levels. The four main levels include: individual, relationships, community and societal.</p>

<p>We used these two frameworks to help us find data to identify and compare community capital in Page and surrounding counties.</p>

<h3>Composite Vulnerability Score Construction</h3>
<p>Our model uses a varimax rotation with the maximum likelihood solution method. Using the correlations with the unobserved factors, we use the following formula to construct the composite vulnerability scores. <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{F} = (X^s\centerdot F^T) \centerdot \textbf{w}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> is the Composite Score, <span class="math inline">\(X^s\)</span> is the Standardized design matrix, <span class="math inline">\(F^T\)</span> is the Matrix of Factor Scores and <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{w}\)</span> is the Proportion of Variance Explained.</p>
